# Dynamic Content Tabs for RMarkdown

This repository includes files for generating dynamic tabs in html files using RMarkdown and includes the resources needed to generate tabs in html files for ggplot and tables in this format. An additional example contained within this repository is the ability to see an example of a git workflow that incorperates many of the aspects of GIT that make it the number 1 choice for developers.

## Background

GIT and version control is not a new concept for developers from all backgrounds however GIT and its associated benefits have not been taken up by the scientific commmunity as would have been expected given the advantages that such approaches could have to science on a broad scale. In part this is added to in stress levels when looked at from a scientific evidnece base. The history of a gitflow approach is openly referenced to a obscure blog post from xx years ago. And the consensus in the developer community is much less than a consensus when it comes to the application of GIT for the most productive and positive outcomes for all workers.

These notes therefore include both information and draft publication for the value of git and github tools for scientific graduates as well as the direct code for creating dynamic tabs in RMarkdown and therefore into HTML webpages.
